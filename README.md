# tradingview-pine-template
This repository contains a boilerplate template that allows anyone to easily craft strategies on trading view. Users simply have to define the trade logic to enter or exit a position.

Note that this repository is a constant work in progress, and I will add more indiciators and expand on the documentation. Feel free to raise any issues if you find errorneous items.

Disclaimer: I am not liable for any losses incurred from using the examples provided in this repository to execute trades. Trade at your own risk!
